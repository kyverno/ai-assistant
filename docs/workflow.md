# Kyverno Maintainer Workflow — What the Agent Does

---

## The model

The agent eliminates mechanical work. The maintainer **decides**; the agent prepares, drafts, and executes. Every action on GitHub requires explicit maintainer confirmation — no silent writes, ever.

After any action or any queue/brief it presents, the agent checks what that unblocks or relates to and names it as an offer, not a separate thing the maintainer has to remember to ask for — the rebase cascade after an approval, the author-nudge during triage, the stale-PR check after a queue, a re-triage offer after a reassignment are instances of this one standing rule, not separate features.

---

## Session open

1. Agent reads what happened last session — what was reviewed, what merged, what's waiting on authors, what was deferred, what issues were triaged.
2. Agent fetches what changed since then, named as real transitions, not a bare count — e.g. exactly which PRs moved `needs-author-action` → `ready-for-review`, which got a new CI result or review, which issues opened, gate status on any branch.
3. Agent surfaces any GitHub Discussion relevant to the current milestone or focus, unprompted — same as the standing GitHub Discussions capability below, just run proactively at session open instead of only on request.
4. Agent asks: **what's the focus today?**
   - A specific milestone
   - A specific author or area (package/directory)
   - Fork PRs needing workflow approval
   - Issue triage
   - A specific PR or issue number
   
   Agent does not default to all-PRs or oldest-first. No fetch happens until focus is set.

---

## PR work

### 1. Queue
Agent fetches all ready PRs matching the focus. Builds the dependency graph — which PRs must come before others (stacked branches, codegen ordering, explicit author dependencies, closing issue conflicts). Presents a tiered queue: PRs that are structurally free to review first, PRs that must wait for others to merge first. Within each tier, agent orders by its own judgment — using session context, maintainer history, what they said they want to get done today.

No maintainer action yet. Just orient — then **offer a guided walkthrough**: work through the queue in that order, one PR at a time (brief → decide → act → next), rather than only handing back a static list. Maintainer can accept, or jump straight to any PR by number instead.

### 2. Per PR — brief
Maintainer picks a PR, or agent recommends where to start. Agent presents:
- What the PR does, what files it touches, which subsystem
- Linked issue it closes, and every other open PR that also references or claims to close it (not just one — a second contributor can open a competing PR against the same issue without being assigned)
- CI status, CodeRabbit summary, unresolved review threads with direct links
- Key comments from the PR, any linked GitHub Discussion, and relevant Slack context — same context-gathering depth as the queue view, not a lighter version for a single PR
- Agent's recommendation: approve / request changes / defer / something else, and why
- **An offer to actually take that action.** On confirmation, the agent performs it in the same turn rather than waiting to be separately asked. On the deep-dive (maintainer asks to go deeper, or a risk signal warrants it), the offer widens to the agent's full action menu — approve, request changes, comment, apply a label, post a question in the linked Discussion or Slack about this PR, or act on the related issue (e.g. nudge a stalled author) — whichever are actually relevant here, not a recitation of every possible action regardless of fit.

### 3. Per PR — maintainer decides

| Decision | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Approve** | Agent posts approval via GitHub API. Marks done in dashboard with timestamp. |
| **Request changes** | Agent drafts the review comment incorporating maintainer's notes. Maintainer confirms or edits the draft. Agent posts it. `needs-author-action` is not applied by the agent — a review isn't a trigger for the real readiness workflow (fork PRs only get a read-only token, so a review couldn't write the label anyway); the existing hourly sweep picks up the unresolved thread and applies it within the hour. |
| **Commit a fix** | Agent confirms the exact fix content with the maintainer first, then commits it directly to the PR's own branch via the GitHub API. Still never a merge. |
| **Defer** | Agent records reason in memory. Marks deferred in dashboard. No GitHub action. |
| **Flag conflict** | Agent drafts a comment on the PR flagging the conflict (e.g. two PRs closing the same issue). Maintainer confirms. Agent posts it. |
| **Nudge the author** | PR is `needs-author-action` and stalled on something urgent (a severe linked issue, a near milestone). Agent drafts a nudge — a reply on a related GitHub Discussion thread if one exists, otherwise a comment on the PR or its linked issue, whichever fits — maintainer confirms, agent posts it. A recommendation the agent raises proactively, not only on request. |
| **Apply e2e-gate-bypass** | Agent cannot do this on its own judgment — a deliberate human safety call, not a missing tool. Agent explains why it's needed and names the exact label. Maintainer applies it manually. |
| **Approve fork workflow run** | Agent cannot do this — no tool wraps this GitHub endpoint, and it exists specifically so a human looks at untrusted fork code before it runs with repo-secrets access. Agent links to the GitHub Actions approval page. Maintainer approves in browser. |

### 4. After approval — rebase cascade
If the just-approved PR has downstream PRs that will now need a rebase, agent proactively flags them: "PRs #X and #Y will need rebase now that #Z is approved. Want me to post a comment on those asking the authors to rebase?" Maintainer confirms. Agent posts the comments.

### 5. Next PR
Agent recommends the next PR in the queue. Maintainer can follow or jump to any PR by number.

---

## Issue work

### 1. Triage queue
Agent fetches new or unlabeled issues since last session. For each one, agent presents:
- Title, body summary, reporter
- Classification guess: bug / feature request / question / duplicate / out-of-scope
- If duplicate candidate: the likely original with a comparison
- **Every PR that references or claims to close this issue** — not just one. Any contributor can open a competing PR against an issue without being assigned to it, so more than one real candidate is a normal outcome, not an edge case; if more than one exists, flag it as possible duplicate effort rather than silently picking one.
- **A progress synthesis**, not a bare link list: given the PR(s) found, how far along is this issue toward resolution — e.g. "PR #X addresses this, currently `needs-author-action`, CI green" rather than just a link.
- Relevant GitHub Discussion and Slack context for this issue, checked with the same depth as a PR gets in the queue view — not a lighter pass just because it's an issue.
- Which subsystem it likely affects — stated as a guess with its basis (labels, file mentions in the body), or named plainly as unclear rather than fabricated.

### 2. Per issue — maintainer decides

| Decision | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Confirm as bug** | Agent applies `bug` label and milestone if specified. |
| **Confirm as feature request** | Agent applies `enhancement` label, optionally milestone. |
| **Mark duplicate** | Agent drafts closing comment: "Duplicate of #X — [one sentence why]." Maintainer confirms or edits. Agent posts it and closes the issue. |
| **Close as out-of-scope** | Agent drafts closing comment explaining why. Maintainer confirms or edits. Agent posts and closes. |
| **Needs more info** | Agent drafts comment asking for the specific missing information. Maintainer confirms or edits. Agent posts it and applies `needs-more-info` label. |
| **Assign to contributor** | Agent posts a comment tagging them and adds them as assignee. |
| **Add to milestone** | Agent applies the milestone to the issue. |
| **Nudge a stalled PR's author** | The issue's linked PR is `needs-author-action` and the issue reads as urgent. Agent drafts a nudge (PR comment or Slack message), maintainer confirms, agent posts it — raised proactively as part of the progress synthesis above, not only on request. |

### 3. Issue relationship surfacing
Always available as part of triage, and on request for the full sweep, agent surfaces the issue graph:
- Issues blocking other issues (detected from issue body text)
- Which issues are related to which PRs, and which PRs are related to which issues — the full graph, not a one-to-one mapping, since duplicate/competing PRs are expected
- Orphaned milestone issues — in the milestone, no linked PR, no assignee
- Issues where the closing PR was later reverted — still open in practice
- Cross-PR overlap — PRs in the queue that touch the same area as open issues
- Milestone health — how many open issues, how many have active PRs, rough velocity

### 4. Staleness housekeeping (on request)
Agent finds:
- `needs-more-info` issues where the reporter replied but the label wasn't removed
- Issues open a long time with no recent activity
- Issues where the reporter commented "fixed in vX" but the issue is still open

For each, agent drafts the closing comment. Maintainer bulk-confirms or skips individually. Agent executes.

### 5. Raising an issue

Two triggers:
- **Surfaced, not requested.** While reading Slack or a GitHub Discussion — during triage, session open, or on request — the agent finds a real user-facing problem with no open issue tracking it (not just an unanswered question). It flags this rather than staying silent, and offers to raise one.
- **Requested directly.** Maintainer asks to raise an issue for something.

Either way: agent drafts the title, body (the problem, reproduction context, and a link back to the source Slack message or Discussion thread when there is one), and a classification guess with labels. Maintainer confirms or edits the full draft — issue content and, where a source thread exists, a link-back reply to it. Agent creates the issue and posts the reply, together, as one confirmed action.

---

## GitHub Discussions
Agent surfaces active discussions relevant to the current milestone or focus area, with links and summaries. Maintainer can ask the agent to go deeper on any discussion — full thread summary, key disagreements, current status, what decision (if any) is needed.

Maintainer can also ask the agent to draft and post a reply to a discussion thread — same confirm-then-post pattern as everything else, the reply shown and confirmed before it's posted. When triage surfaces a user-facing problem in a Discussion thread, the agent offers both: raise a tracking issue for it (above) and/or reply in the thread acknowledging it — the same reply mechanism, not a separate one.

---

## Session close

1. Agent summarizes what happened: approvals posted, review comments sent, commits made, nudges sent, issues triaged, labels applied, deferred items with reasons.
2. Writes session summary to memory — available at the start of next session.
3. Updates dashboard: marks completed items with timestamp, updates deferred list, updates milestone health.
4. Flags follow-ups: PRs waiting on author response, issues waiting on more-info reply, PRs at risk of merge conflict.

---

## What the agent cannot do

- Merge PRs — hard block at token scope, never negotiable. This is the one write action that stays off-limits regardless of maintainer confirmation; everything else below — commenting, committing a fix, labeling, requesting changes, approving a review, posting a nudge — is allowed once confirmed.
- Apply `e2e-gate-bypass` — a deliberate human safety call, not a missing tool (the agent could mechanically apply the label the same way it applies any other). Agent suggests, maintainer applies manually.
- Approve workflow runs — no tool wraps GitHub's workflow-run-approval endpoint, and the gate exists specifically so a human looks at untrusted fork-PR code before it runs with repo-secrets access. Agent links to the page, maintainer approves in browser.
- Any GitHub write without the maintainer confirming the drafted action first

---

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the Kyverno tab in `hermes -p kyverno dashboard` (`localhost:9119`), one URL for the lifetime of the installation. The agent updates it after every queue, brief, or triage it presents and after every confirmed action, through `update_dashboard` (the `dashboard-sync` skill). The tab re-reads its state every 15 seconds, so a reload is optional. The maintainer has everything in one place with proper links.

It should be a page the maintainer actually wants to leave open — real visual design, not a bare table dump, and interactive: sortable/filterable panels, click through from a summary row into its detail panel.

**Session header**
Current date, milestone in focus, where things were left last session, quick status: ready PRs, gate status, PRs needing maintainer action, open issues vs milestone total.

**PR queue panel**
The latest queue, in tier order. Per PR: number + title linked to GitHub, tier, hard constraints if any, warnings, current real state, the agent's verdict/recommendation, and related items (overlaps, the issue it closes, any Discussion/Slack thread found) — every row carries this, not a reduced subset. PRs the maintainer acted on are marked with timestamp and what action was taken.

**Fork PRs needing workflow approval**
Separate section. Each linked to its GitHub PR and the Actions run awaiting approval.

**Per-PR detail panels** (added as maintainer dives in)
Full brief: file classification, changed files, linked issue, CI status, CodeRabbit summary, unresolved threads with links, key comments, any linked Discussion. What the agent recommended. What the maintainer decided.

**Issue panel**
Same shape as the PR panel: current state, triage classification and progress synthesis, every related PR (plural — duplicate/competing PRs included), related Discussion/Slack context, a real link. Plus milestone health — open issues, issues with active PRs, orphaned issues; triage queue — new issues since last session; relationship flags — duplicate candidates, blocked issue chains, reverted-closer issues, staleness flags.

**GitHub Discussions panel**
Active discussions relevant to the current milestone — what's actually being discussed, agent-summarized, not just a title list. Linked to GitHub, with status and what decision (if any) is pending.

**Session history**
What was reviewed, approved, deferred, triaged, closed last session. Links to everything touched.

## Build plan

PR-queue-building (the Queue/brief/Slack+Discussions-context parts of "PR work"), Phase 1,
most of Phase 2, and the dashboard (Phase 3) below are built. Still to build: session open/close,
the rebase cascade, and the write-scope expansion for committing a fix. Four
independently-shippable phases, in this order:

### Findings this plan rests on (verified live, not assumed)

- **Probed the real `github-mcp-server` tool surface directly** (stdio `tools/list` against
  the real container, `GITHUB_TOOLSETS=all`, 90 tools returned). No tool anywhere wraps
  GitHub's workflow-run-approval or pending-deployment-review endpoints — "Approve fork
  workflow run: agent cannot do this" above is a real tool-coverage gap, not a policy choice,
  and stays link-only. `create_or_update_file`/`push_files`/`delete_file` do exist and are
  currently excluded — what "Commit a fix" above needs.
- **Asked directly about workflow-run approval** once it was clear it's a security gate (a
  human looking at untrusted fork code before it runs with repo-secrets access, not a
  correctness check) — kept link-only on purpose, not just because no tool exists.
- **Write-scope policy, decided this round**: a file-write tool is now in scope — commenting,
  committing, approving reviews, labeling, requesting changes all happen with maintainer
  confirmation. `merge_pull_request` is the one hard, non-negotiable block (token scope +
  allowlist + hook, three independent layers).
- **The real dashboard mechanism**, confirmed from a live first-party example
  (`~/.hermes/hermes-agent/plugins/kanban/`): a Hermes dashboard-plugin ships
  `dashboard/manifest.json` (name/label/icon/tab position/entry JS/css/api) plus a FastAPI
  backend, mounted at `/api/plugins/<name>/`, its own tab in `hermes dashboard`
  (`localhost:9119`) — not a claude.ai artifact, and not real-time push; it updates on skill
  action, the same as every panel in that real example.
- **No generic structured key-value/JSON store exists yet** in this project's memory layer —
  only Mnemosyne's id-keyed `remember`/`recall` and its 5-predicate triple store, neither a
  good fit for sortable dashboard state or a session-to-session diff snapshot. The dashboard
  plugin owns its own small local JSON state file instead.
- `plugins/kyverno-fetch/fetch.py`'s GraphQL/REST helpers (search → concurrent detail pass →
  cross-ref extraction/resolution, the `issueOrPullRequest` union lookup, the cross-reference
  regex) are directly reusable for an issue-side fetch — read, not assumed from the PR-side
  tool's shape.
- **Probed the real `github-mcp-server` tool surface again for this phase** (stdio
  `tools/list`, `GITHUB_TOOLSETS=all`, 90 tools returned): there is no `create_issue` tool.
  Issue creation is `issue_write` with `method: "create"` — the same multiplexed tool already
  in `config.yaml`'s `tools.include`, just not restricted to `labels` the way `pr-actions`
  restricts it for PRs. **No new tool grant needed** for raising an issue — corrects the
  earlier assumption in this doc that a separate `create_issue` grant would be required.

### Phase 1 — Issue work (triage, actions, relationship graph, staleness, raising) — BUILT

`fetch_issue_candidates` (`plugins/kyverno-fetch/fetch.py`/`tools.py`), `skills/issue-triage/`,
and `skills/issue-actions/` landed 2026-10-05. `closedByPullRequestsReferences` and
`ClosedEvent.closer` were verified live end to end against `kyverno/kyverno` (not just schema
introspection) — see `docs/architecture.md`. No `config.yaml` tool grant changed —
`issue_write`/`add_issue_comment`/`issue_read`/`search_issues`/`list_issues` already covered
triage, the decide-table, and raising an issue (`issue_write` with `method: "create"`,
verified above — there is no separate `create_issue` tool); `discussion_comment_write` for the
Discussion-reply piece was already granted too, and `skills/discussions` already implemented
the confirm-then-post reply flow this phase reuses rather than rebuilding. Only the
explanatory comment on `issue_write` changed, to say `pr-actions` restricts it to `labels` for
PRs — `issue-actions` carries no such restriction, since it operates on real issues. Relationship
surfacing and staleness housekeeping are written as on-request procedures in `issue-triage` but
not yet run against a real backlog in a live session; the revert-detection heuristic there is
explicitly best-effort.

- `plugins/kyverno-fetch/fetch.py` gained `fetch_issue_candidates(repo, search_query, limit)` —
  same template as `fetch_pr_candidates`, swapped to `is:issue`/`... on Issue`, plus an
  issue-relevant field set (`labels`, `assignees`, `milestone`, `comments`, `closedByPullRequestsReferences`,
  `timelineItems` for closer/revert detection — field names verified live, not assumed).
- `skills/issue-triage/`: classification guess, the issue↔PR relationship graph
  (every PR that references or claims to close an issue, not just one — flags duplicate
  effort when more than one exists), the progress synthesis ("PR #X addresses this, currently
  `needs-author-action`, CI green"), the same Slack+Discussions context pass `pr-queue` does
  for PRs, the author-nudge recommendation, subsystem guess (or an honest "unclear"). When
  that Slack/Discussions pass turns up a user-facing problem with no open issue, flags it as
  a raise-issue candidate rather than passing over it.
- `skills/issue-actions/`: the full decide-table — confirm bug/feature, mark
  duplicate, close out-of-scope, needs-more-info, assign, add-to-milestone, nudge author,
  raise an issue (drafted title/body/labels, plus a link-back reply when the source was a
  Slack message or Discussion thread — one confirmed action covering both). Confirm-then-post
  throughout. Guardrail: `state`/`assignees`/`milestone` only ever on a real Issue number,
  verified via `issueOrPullRequest`/`issue_read` — never a PR.
- Relationship surfacing and staleness housekeeping (on request): blocking-issue text
  references, orphaned milestone issues, reverted-closer issues (best-effort), cross-PR/
  open-issue area overlap, milestone health; `needs-more-info` where the reporter already
  replied, long-stale issues, "fixed in vX" still-open issues.

### Phase 2 — PR decision-table completion, recommend-and-offer, write-scope expansion — PARTLY BUILT

Landed 2026-10-06: **Request changes** does *not* also apply `needs-author-action` —
checked the real `pr-readiness-check.yaml`: a review isn't a trigger for it at all (fork
PRs only ever get a read-only token, so a review couldn't write the label anyway); the
hourly sweep applies it from the unresolved-thread state, so the agent doing it too would
just be racing a mechanism already about to do it. **Flag conflict**, **Nudge the
author** (a related Discussion reply, or a PR/issue comment — no Slack), **Apply
e2e-gate-bypass** (explain + name the label, never apply it) are built in
`pr-actions/SKILL.md`. **Approve fork workflow run** now builds the real approval-page
link from `actions_list`'s own `html_url`, in `pr-queue`. **Recommend-and-offer** is
built: the queue presentation offers the guided walkthrough; the review brief's
recommendation gets an offer to execute it in the same turn; the deep-dive widens that
to the full relevant menu (approve/request-changes/comment/label/Discussion-or-issue
nudge/hand off to `author-followup`) — Slack dropped from this menu, same reason as the
nudge above.

**Defer** (record a reason in memory and on the dashboard, no GitHub action) is built too.

**Deliberately skipped this round, by maintainer decision:** the **rebase cascade**
(re-checking `sequence_prs` for downstream PRs after an approval) — not built.

**Not done — a real write-scope decision, not mechanical:**

- `distribution.yaml`: `GITHUB_TOKEN` description gains `Contents Write`.
- `config.yaml`: move `create_or_update_file`/`push_files` into
  `mcp_servers.github.tools.include`; regenerate the exclude-list comment's "exact complement"
  via the same live `tools/list` probe. `delete_file` and `merge_pull_request` stay excluded.
- `pr-actions/SKILL.md`: new **commit a fix** procedure (confirm exact content first, commit
  straight to the PR's own branch, report the SHA — never a merge, never another branch).

This is the one piece of Phase 2 that gives the agent real code-write capability against
a live OSS repo, not just labels/comments — needs an explicit decision (and confirmation
the real PAT already carries Contents:Write on GitHub's side) before touching
`config.yaml`.

**Known debt from this phase:** `pr-queue/SKILL.md` is now 24,937 characters, over the
~24k linter threshold item 1 already named — the walkthrough-offer and execute-offer
additions pushed it there. The split in `docs/v3-plan.md` item 1 is still not done.

### Phase 3 — Dashboard — BUILT

The tab renders live and `dashboard-sync` is wired into `pr-queue`, `issue-triage`, `author-followup`, `discussions`, `pr-actions`, and `issue-actions`. The UI is styled entirely from the host's theme tokens so it follows the active Hermes theme.

New bundled plugin, `plugins/kyverno-dashboard/`:

- Tool half (same `__init__.py`/`tools.py` contract as `kyverno-fetch`/`kyverno-sequencer`):
  one tool, `update_dashboard(section, data)`, writing structured JSON to a local state file.
  Verify Hermes's real plugin writable-data-directory API live before picking a path.
- Dashboard-tab half: `dashboard/manifest.json` + `plugin_api.py` (FastAPI, reading that same
  state file, mounted at `/api/plugins/kyverno-dashboard/`) + `dist/index.js`/`style.css` — no
  build pipeline unless the manifest genuinely requires one.
- Real design effort — sortable/filterable, click-through to detail panels, not a JSON table
  dump. Every panel above (PR queue, issue, fork-approval, per-item detail, Discussions,
  session history) gets built here, each row carrying state + verdict + related items + link.
- Every confirmed write action from Phase 1/2 calls `update_dashboard` right after.

### Phase 4 — Session open/close, "what changed," proactive Discussions

Reads from all three other phases, so it lands last.

- New skill `skills/session/` (or folded into `pr-queue`'s Step 0 — decide the seam when
  implementing): session open recalls the last summary, runs the "what changed" diff (a small
  snapshot-vs-current comparison, reported as named transitions like `needs-author-action` →
  `ready-for-review`, not a bare count), surfaces relevant Discussions unprompted, then asks
  the focus question (now also offering issue triage and a specific PR/issue number).
- Session close: self-reports every confirmed action taken this conversation, `mnemosyne_
  remember`s it as the next session's "last summary," updates the dashboard's session history
  and milestone health, flags follow-ups.

### Verification

- Phase 1: an issue with two independent PRs shows both, flagged, with a progress synthesis;
  Slack/Discussions checked for issues the same as for PRs; `issue-actions` never touches
  `state`/`assignees`/`milestone` on a PR; a raise-issue draft (from a direct request or a
  triage-surfaced finding) never calls `issue_write` with `method: "create"` before the
  maintainer confirms the exact title/body; a Discussion reply triggered from issue-triage
  goes through the same
  `discussion_comment_write` confirm-then-post flow as `skills/discussions`, not a duplicate.
- Phase 2: `create_or_update_file` succeeds against a real PR branch with the new scope;
  Request Changes applies the review and the label together; the queue offers a walkthrough;
  a review brief offers to execute its own recommendation in the same turn.
- Phase 3: `hermes dashboard` shows the new tab; a Phase 1/2 action shows up with a timestamp
  within one session; re-running an action updates the entry rather than duplicating it.
- Phase 4: flip a real PR's label via Phase 2's tools, confirm the next session-open names
  that exact transition; confirm session close's summary matches the real actions taken.
